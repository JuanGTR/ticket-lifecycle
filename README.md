<p>On the end user site, http://localhost/osTicket/ we can submit tickets and choose from the help topics that we set up previously, a summary of the problem, and the details. I submitted a few different examples.

Next, we will “solve” the tickets by logging in as an agent at http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php, with one of the agent accounts created. Here you can see the tickets that have been submitted and manage them.

Here we can see one of the specific tickets that were submitted, and there are various things we can do here. You can change the status of the ticket, change the priority, assign departments and specific agents, post comment updates, and close/resolve the ticket. These are all things you would be doing while working on a real issue.
